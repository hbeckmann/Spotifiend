#### Development notes

Due to the smaller nature of the project I have opted to leave many of the components in the Dashboard.js file. Ideally these would be broken out into individual files so that it is easier to navigate and maintain.

Potential future improvements:

- Example page for users who don't currently have a Spotify account
- Interesting ways to share your statistics on social media
- Other streaming platform support?
